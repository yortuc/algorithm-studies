/*
	Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of
	times, give an O(log n) algorithm that finds an element in the array. You may assume
	that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.

	EXAMPLE:
	Input: find 5 in array (15 16 19 20 25 1 3 4 5 7 10 14)
	Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)

	ROTATION:
	rotating a sorted array clockwise or anti-clockwise
	1,2,3,4,5 -> 5,1,2,3,4 (1 times clockwise) -> 4,5,1,2,3 (twice clockwise)

	* if we know the index of the min element of the array,  we know how many times the array is rotated.

	* use binary search which has a time complexity of O(logn)

	4,5,1,2,3 -> 1 is the pivot element. both the items on the left and rights sides of pivot element are greated
				 than the pivot element. no other item in the array that property.
